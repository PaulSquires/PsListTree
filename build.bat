rem main.rc embeds main_manifest.xml as resource type 24 (RT_MANIFEST). That manifest is what
rem makes the process DPI-AWARE. Without it Windows reports 96 DPI whatever the user's scaling
rem is and bitmap-stretches the window -- which silently invalidates every geometry assertion
rem that derives a scaled pen width. fbc compiles a .rc listed on the command line and links
rem the result automatically.
